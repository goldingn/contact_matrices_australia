# Synthetic contact matrices for Australian populations

An analysis repo to create synthetic contact matrices for different populations in Australia, particularly areas of socioeconomic disadvantage and first nations remote comunities. Will mostly use the [conmat R package](https://github.com/njtierney/conmat), but also incorporate other data sources.
